# Advanced Shell

Based on the shell lab done during the semester, we added three major functionalities: fg/bg, interactive bash scirpter, and history. The skeleton was based on Yihao's shell for another course, and all new functiaonalies are all writen by us. Specifically, fg/bg and interactive shell skeleton was written by Yihao; functions of interactive shell was mainly written by Weikun, and history was written by Shouzhuo.
